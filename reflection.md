- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I think it's a very smart way to protect your code and would probably be most handy in addressing security issues with code
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Again, office hours and talking with my peers was extremely helpful. Olohi helped me a lot in thinking through how I wanted to implement my code. My advice to future students would be to pace out the homework so that it doesn't feel overwhelming and to read the discord questions channel. I usually find very interesting and useful information there.
